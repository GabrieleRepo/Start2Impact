# Complete analysis of a dataset

This project involves analyzing data from a second-hand clothing marketplace, where people can resell their clothing. I will proceed to explore the data in the csv file through the E.D.A. (Exploratory Data Analysis) process on Python and then I will display the data graphically using Tableau Visualization. 
The final purpose of this work is to propose a strategy to maximize the company’s profits via a thorough analysis of the data and the identification of possible areas for optimization.
Here you can find the dataset and the Python code I used to perform the analysis.
