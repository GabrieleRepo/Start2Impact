# Python with Pandas

From the data provided by the Google Play Store dataset, I had access to information for each app such as rating, reviews, number of installs, type (paid or free), price, and category. The goal was to identify the best category to develop an app. I described the dataset and analyzed correlations between variables, outliers, categories with the most competition, and those with the most interest. 
Finally, I proposed a strategy using a data-driven approach.
Here you can find the dataset and the Python code I used to perform the analysis.
